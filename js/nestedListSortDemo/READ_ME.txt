To use the demo files, do the following:

1.  Put the appropriate values in the <cfset> statements in the onApplicationStart function of the Application.cfc file.
2.  Use the comments at the top of the _createDemoData.cfm file to create the two needed tables in your database, then run the _createDemoData.cfm file to populate the data.

That should do it!
