How +Jade works

1. get_user hook is initiliazed at system.ready
	gets user from url (as subdomain or domain map)
	queries db and returns site session (site_id, theme, custom files)

2. build_page hook is initiliazed at system.ready after get_user
	build_page gets page (1st controller in url)
	if page = "e" this means we are in edit mode.
		the routes.php routes to normal controller/method mode of our modules
		(used to edit/configure modules)
	else
		queries db to retrieve relevent page layout prefences
		if page not found = 404 error
		else
			if the page calls a module (one of our controllers)
				create new controller instance
				build the page around this controller
				execute the controller instance
			else
				the page has no module
				send to custom_page controller where page is displayed normally.
